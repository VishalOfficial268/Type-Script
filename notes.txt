Notes for TS:
[+] .ts file will never run as like .js file so basically we always have to run .js file after compiling.
[+] In typescript there are 3 core data types - number, string and boolean.
[+] number data types will consider both integer and float value.
[+] if we have an error in .ts file and hit the cmd to compile then it will compile as changes in the .js file 
    but also gives the error in the .js file.
[+] infrence guess the type automatically based on the previous data or variables assigned.
[+] If a veriable is assiged as undefined and then the type will be "any"
[+] If we need a varible as like constant value then we can use like let data:5 = 5; (here :5 is constant)
     other than 5 no value will be assigned.
[+] In the const if we have assigned a certain value then the const value will the assigned value as like e.g 5

[+] cmd - tsc --init -> It will init the ts config file automatic.
[+] files that we want to compile as ts file to make it in another file as same file with .js ext.
[+] we should change the config of the file as  "rootDir" to give the desired folder from where all the ts files takes and 
    give the target folder as "outDir" folder as desired folder.
    eg - rootDir:./src(folder) -----> outDir:./public (folder)
[+] for file config as all file will be affected doing such as the above mentioned example. So for preventing such we can 
    also  make configurations like below.
    need to add "include": [give_folder_name] e.g- "include":["src"]
